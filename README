A collection of experiments and play with the Aalto synth from Madrona Labs.

Goofing 1- squelchy lead with an edge
Sequenced Bleep- using the sequencer to control a congested little bleep blop
Unsequenced Congest Bleep- variation on the Sequenced Bleep but with keyed input
Keep it simple stupid- my attempt to not complicate things too quickly, a little warm bubbly bright-ish lead
